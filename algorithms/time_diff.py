''' Time series diagnostics

These started life as ``tsdiffana.m`` - see
http://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/imaging/DataDiagnostics

Oliver Josephs (FIL) gave Matthew Brett the idea of time-point to time-point
subtraction as a diagnostic for motion and other sudden image changes.
This has been implemented in the Nipy package.

We give here a simpler implementation with modified dependences

def time_slice_diffs(img):
    ''' Time-point to time-point differences over volumes and slices

    We think of the passed array as an image.
    The last dimension is assumed to be time. 

    Parameters
    ----------
    img: 4D Niimg-like,
         the input (4D) image

    Returns
    -------
    results : dict

        ``T`` is the number of time points (``arr.shape[time_axis]``)

        ``S`` is the number of slices (``arr.shape[slice_axis]``)

        ``v`` is the shape of a volume (``rollimg(arr, time_axis)[0].shape``)

        ``d2[t]`` is the volume of squared differences between voxels at
        time point ``t`` and time point ``t+1``

        `results` has keys:

        * 'volume_mean_diff2' : (T-1,) array
           array containing the mean (over voxels in volume) of the
           squared difference from one time point to the next
        * 'slice_mean_diff2' : (T-1, S) array
           giving the mean (over voxels in slice) of the difference from
           one time point to the next, one value per slice, per
           timepoint
        * 'volume_means' : (T,) array
           mean over voxels for each volume ``vol[t] for t in 0:T``
        * 'slice_diff2_max_vol' : v[:] array
           volume, of same shape as input time point volumes, where each slice
           is is the slice from ``d2[t]`` for t in 0:T-1, that has the largest
           variance across ``t``.  Thus each slice in the volume may well result
           from a different difference time point.
        * 'diff2_mean_vol`` : v[:] array
           volume with the mean of ``d2[t]`` across t for t in 0:T-1.
